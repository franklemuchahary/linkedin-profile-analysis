# Analysis of LinkedIn Profiles for Creating a Career Playbook

<a href="https://datajanitors.pythonanywhere.com/">Link to the Interactive Plotly Dashboard.</a>

<hr>

The goal of this project is to analyze the career paths of multiple top professionals (Principal Data Scientists, Senior Consultants, Chief Technology Officers) and build a career success playbook. This playbook could potentially act as a guide to help people be more job-ready or move up the corporate ladder by taking inspiration from the paths of professionals who have already reached the top of the ladder.<br><br>
Having the right skillset increases the “job readiness” of the candidates and reduces the investment an employer needs to make in re-training their hirees. Employers have reported that there is a steadily widening “skills gap” that is hurting workers, businesses, and the economy.[1] There are also reports explaining how skill-based hiring has been increasing over the past few years.[2] So, having the right skills to focus on for a dream job has become even more important. We envision that the playbook will be helpful for current students, early career professionals, people looking for work after a resume gap, and professionals looking to switch careers by obtaining the right skill sets needed for their career goals.

## Scope of the Project

We plan to look for 3 different types of professionals:
- Principal Data Scientists
- Chief Technology Officers (CTOs)
- Senior Consultants (primarily Partners, Principals, Associate Partners at top consulting firms like McKinsey, BCG, Bain & Company etc.)

We plan to get the following data points from mentioned successful individuals:
- Level of education (High school, Bachelors, Masters or PhD)
- Type of education (MBA or MS, Engineering or Hospitality, Technology or Biology)
- Total experience
- Designations worked on (business analyst, software engineer, senior software engineer, etc.)
- Skill set possessed

We then intend to analyze the following data points to obtain the career paths they have followed:
- Average experience in each company (will help our readers know the ideal time to switch companies)
- Past professional roles held by these professionals
- Most popular education level by career path
- Most popular majors by career path
- The most popular skills by career path

The entire analysis will be performed in Python and we will be using libraries like `Selenium`, `Plotly`, `Dash`, `re`, `multiprocessing`, `Pandas`, `datetime`, `logging`

## Data Preparation

The data preparation process of this project involves searching for profiles on `LinkedIn` for three types of positions using multiple keywords, extracting profile links of multiple professionals in these fields, scraping information from individual profiles, and cleaning/consolidating data. These careers/positions are Chief Technology Officer, Principal Data Scientists, and Senior Management Consultants. We carried out the scraping process in a two-step process where we first fetched the links, followed by detailed information from each profile, further detailed below. `Selenium` has been used as the key tool for scraping and `multiprocessing` has been used to aid in speeding up the process. Further, we have cleaned and transformed the scraped data using `regex`, `pandas`, and `dateutil`. At the end of the entire process, this scraped data has been saved as three different files, each containing three different sets of information, i.e `eduation information`, `experience information`, and `skills information`. We did not merge these three datasets into one single consolidated master file as a part of our data preparation step because they contain different sets of information that will mostly be analyzed individually (or could be merged if or when required for our analysis). Additionally, all three are at different levels of granularity, which will be detailed below. The key used to tie all three datasets together is `profile_id_dummy`.

**Final Datasets**
- [all_education_info.csv](data/final_cleaned_files/all_education_info.csv): Education Data for all profiles
- [all_name_and_experience_info.csv](data/final_cleaned_files/all_name_and_experience_info.csv): Professional Experience Data for all profiles
- [all_skills_info.csv](data/final_cleaned_files/all_skills_info.csv): List of skills listed in each profile

**Code Files**
- [get_profile_links.py](code/get_profile_links.py): Code for scraping profile links from LinkedIn for each profile type
- [clean_scraped_data_part0.py](code/clean_scraped_data_part0.py): Code for cleaning up the profile links fetched and adding dummy profile ids
- [scrape_individual_profiles.py](code/scrape_individual_profiles.py): Code for fetching information from individual profiles
- [clean_scraped_data_part1.py](code/clean_scraped_data_part1.py): Code for cleaning up all the information fetched from each LinkedIn profile
- [concatenating_and_merging.py](code/concatenating_and_merging.py): Code for final consolidation of all files to create 3 base files


## Data Dictionary
The data dictionary has been detailed out below in the form of a table. It contains information about three different csv files that were generated as the final set of files at the end of our data preparation process. The file that these specific columns are present in can be identified using the file name and path present in the column named as `Data`. <br>
<i>
`Note:`
- At the end of the data dictionary table, we have only listed out three of 100s of such skills that are present in the `all_skills_info.csv` dataset because of the one-hot encoded wide format of this dataset. We carried out this encoding process to help us in making quick calculations to see which skills are listed by how many people.
- GitHub might not render these files directly due to the large number of columns present inside it.

## Visualizations

In this project, our primary goal was to analyze how people in top positions within three different career tracks have built their careers up in terms of skills developed, education levels, and past experiences. To analyze this, we have scrapped LinkedIn profiles from three career tracks (Principal Data Scientists, Senior Consultants, and Chief Technology Officers) and analyzed the information that these people have listed in terms of skills, education levels, and past experiences on LinkedIn. These are the three main components we will be looking at, and the following three exploratory analyses listed are the three main stories we will be focusing on:
1. **Skills:** We will be analyzing the skills that the people from these three different career paths listed on their LinkedIn and if there are certain specific skills that people are interested in as one of the paths to actively pursue.
2. **Education:** For education, we will look at two main aspects, the education levels and the majors pursued by the professionals from the above-mentioned career paths. Based on this, we will analyze if there are any common patterns for each path.
3. **Experience:** For experience, we will mainly analyze the past experiences of the professionals in the three paths. We will analyze three aspects related to experience, the number of months of work experience held by the professionals previously,  past roles held, and finally, the number of years/number of positions held by these professionals at their current companies.

## Conclusion and Discussion
In the data gathering and consolidation phase of the project, we started by identifying the methods that were available to us for gathering and extracting data from LinkedIn (Scraping or APIs). We decided to go ahead with the scraping approach because of the requirements associated with getting an API key and the rate limits that were involved in using the APIs. Once, the required data was scraped from LinkedIn, we cleaned & transformed the data obtained into a structured format. Finally, in this phase, we created three final files that would be used for all further analysis. 

In the second phase of our project, we analyzed the information that we collected on the experience, education, and skillsets of multiple top professionals in three different fields (Principal Data Scientists, Senior Consultants, and Chief Technology Officers). Our goal was to find common patterns that successful people in these fields have followed in the past. Hence, we analyzed the top skills listed by these professionals, their educational backgrounds (education levels and majors), and finally their past professional experiences (overall years of experience, past roles, and experience at their current company). Based on our analysis we have observed the following major insights:
1. Technical skills are quite important for Principal Data Scientists and the top skills seem to be Python, Machine Learning, R, SQL, Statistics, and Microsoft Excel. We already know that Python, Machine Learning, and R are quite popular these days. But young professionals planning to get into data science should also focus on sharpening their knowledge of Statistics and focus on getting good at SQL.
2. Knowing how to develop business strategies seems to be the top skill for consultants which is an obvious skill. However, one interesting skill listed by these professionals was data analysis. Hence, junior consultants should focus on working on their data analysis skills too.
3. Soft skills like leadership and management are quite important for both Chief Technology Officers and Consultants. People in senior technical roles looking to become CTOs in the future should not focus entirely on technical skills and work on obtaining and mastering these soft skills.
4. Ph.D. or at least a Master's Degree seems to be quite popular amongst Principal Data Scientists. An MBA is the best bet to get into the consulting world. For, CTOs, the level of education makes less of a difference and experience is what matters more than the level of education.
5. For CTOs and Principal Data Scientists, the preferred major would be a STEM Non-Engineering major that includes majors like Computer Science, Physics, Maths, Statistics, Chemistry, etc. For, Senior Consultants the most popular is a combination of an MBA and an Engineering Undergraduate (This might probably be because an engineering undergraduate provides them the analytical skills required in consultancy and the MBA develops their business acumen making them good candidates for top consultancy roles).
6. As we mentioned earlier, experience seems to be an important asset for Chief Technology Officers. People eyeing this role should try to gather as much relevant experience as possible. This relevant experience should ideally be in terms of both managerial experiences as well as technical experience.
7. People looking into top Data Science and Consultancy roles should focus on working their way up from entry-level positions and students should focus on gathering experience through internships. For slightly experienced consultants, the recommendation would be to stick with their current companies and work their way up through internal promotions.

Using the insights obtained from our exploratory analysis, we have created a career playbook in the form of an interactive dashboard (Links have been provided above) that university students, early career professionals, people looking to switch careers, and people returning to the workforce after a career break can refer to in order to help them be successful in their pursuit of these fields. The observations and insights from the interactive dashboard can serve as a guidance tool or reference book for our target audience so they are not lost and have a focused path to follow in order to achieve their dream positions in the industry. It could also help young professionals and students develop the right skill sets required for setting their foot into one of these career paths. Dashboards like these can also be leveraged by career counselors at universities and private career consultants so that they are able to guide the students or clients in a much more effective manner backed by data. Finally, another main advantage of dashboards like these is that they are easily automatable and can provide up-to-date information in terms of what skills/tools/technologies are popular in the current job market.<br>
